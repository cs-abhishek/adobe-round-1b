Machine Learning Fundamentals in Healthcare

Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine learning has revolutionized many industries, particularly healthcare. 
This document explores fundamental concepts and applications.

Supervised Learning
Supervised learning algorithms learn from labeled training data to make predictions 
on new, unseen data. Common applications include image classification and diagnosis.

Convolutional Neural Networks
CNNs are particularly effective for image analysis tasks. In medical imaging, 
they can detect patterns in X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans with high accuracy.

Transfer Learning
Pre-trained models can be fine-tuned for specific medical tasks, reducing 
training time and improving performance on smaller datasets.

Deep Learning Applications
Deep learning has shown remarkable success in medical image analysis, 
drug discovery, and genomics research.

Computer Vision in Medicine
Computer vision techniques enable automated analysis of medical images, 
supporting radiologists and improving diagnostic accuracy.

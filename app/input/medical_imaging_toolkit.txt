Medical Image Processing Toolkit Documentation

Overview
This toolkit provides functions for processing and analyzing medical images using 
machine learning and computer vision techniques.

Image Preprocessing
Functions for noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and image normalization are 
essential for preparing medical images for analysis.

Feature Extraction
The toolkit includes methods for extracting relevant features from medical images, 
including texture analysis and morphological operations.

Classification Algorithms
Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Neural Networks are implemented 
for image classification tasks.

Deep Learning Integration
TensorFlow and PyTorch integrations allow for custom CNN architectures and 
pre-trained model usage.

Performance Metrics
Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score calculations are available for model 
evaluation on medical datasets.
